## Development notes

This is an inspiration from my childhood memory 爆走兄弟レッツ&ゴー and Pokemon Go.

The idea is to bring together younger generations and artitsts around the world through NFTs and competitive racing mini game. Hopefully, by the time to purchase their very first car, Mazda brand awareness will be formed through this application.
